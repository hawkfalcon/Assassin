# Assassin
Script for managing assassin game (node.js email sending and receiving)

This is a very specific repository used for a real life assassin game. However, it uses a lot of interesting node.js libraries. I hope this can be useful to someone. It does:

1. Email sending via nodemailer
2. Email receiving via smtp-server and mailparser
  - Checks for commands from the email
  
3. Send and receive tests (only US, uses email->text)
4. Other little helpful things such as JSON and CLI arguments
